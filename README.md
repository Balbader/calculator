# The Calculator Project

## Guidelines

1.  Your calculator id going to contain functions for all of the basic math
    operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions
    for the following items and testing them in your browser's console.<br>

        1. add
        2. substract
        3. multiply
        4. divide

2.  Create a new function `operate` that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then
    calls one of the above functions on the numbers.<br>
